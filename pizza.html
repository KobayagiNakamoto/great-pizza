    <h2>What is the difference between good and great pizza?</h2>

    <p>
        Let's face it. You have to really try in order to mess up a pizza. Instead of kneading, you can buy pre-made
        dough.
        Throw your ingredients of choice on it, whack it in an owen and wait it out while you munch on leftover grated
        cheese.
        I guarantee you that anyone that takes a bite, can put a label "decent" on it.

    <h2>Meassurements</h2>

        alt="Mixing flour in a bowl">

    <p>
        With baker's percentages, every ingredient is represented by its proportion by weight to the flour in a recipe.

        When coupled with the metric system and its logical base-ten measures, it helps liberate you from recipes.
    </p>

    <p>
        So, for instance, if a pizza dough recipe calls for 60% water (also known as 60% hydration), 2% salt, and .5%
        yeast,
        that means that for every 1,000 grams of flour, you'd add 600 grams of water, 20 grams of salt, and 5 grams of
        yeast.
    </p>

    <p>
        The advantage of the system is that it allows you to scale a recipe up and down freely without having to
        recalculate fussy cups or tablespoons.
        Once you get yourself a scale that measures in grams, you'll be throwing together batches of dough, large or
        small, in no time.

    <h2>Choosing the right flour</h2>

    <p>
        Flour is the main ingredient in pizza dough, and the type you use can have a big effect on the end result.
        All-purpose flour will work fine, but if you want a chewier crumb and a better hole structure, you should
        consider buying yourself some high protein bread flour. I use either King Arthur-brand bread flour, or imported

        Antimo Caputo bread or pizza flour (which is ground more finely than its American flour counterparts).

    <p>
        Are you looking for hardcore Neapolitan-style pizza with fresh mozzarella and a soft, crisp crust?
        Or are you in the mood for New York-style pizza, with a more substantial crunch and a layer of grated, dry
        mozzarella?
    </p>
    <p>
        If you're looking to feed a large crowd with minimal fuss and fool-proof end results,
        then you might consider attempting a Sicilian-style square pie, or an easy no-knead, no-stretch pan pizza.

    <h2>Fermentation</h2>

    <hr />
    <img src="Images/20160503-pizza-tools-equipment-09-1500x1125.jpg" height="300" width="400" alt="dough in container">
    <p>
        Cold fermenting your dough—that is, storing it in the refrigerator after forming it, can help improve
        both its flavor and, its browning characteristics as the yeast slowly gets to work digesting carbohydrates.
    </p>

    <h2>Heat</h2>

    <hr />

    <br />

    <span> Why does the local pizzeria's pizza taste better than the stuff you make at home? </span>
    <p>
        It's likely because their oven is hotter than yours. A hotter oven leads to superior oven-spring—the early phase
        of baking
        during which air and vapor bubbles inside dough rapidly expand, causing the dough to become airy and full of
        holes.
        A hot oven also creates a better contrast between crisp, lightly charred exterior, and soft, cloud-like
        interior.

    </p>

    <span>At the very least, you should be baking your pizzas as hot as your oven will go—generally in the 550°F
        range</span>
